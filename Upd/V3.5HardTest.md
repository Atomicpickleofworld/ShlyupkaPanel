# 🚀 ShlyupkaPanel v3.5 — Hard-Test Edition  
_🧪 Experimental Systems Update_

📅 **Release Date:** [Expected: This week]  
📦 **Status:** PreRelease / Beta  
🛠️ **Type:** Development build with experimental but promising features

---

## ✅ 1. MaxEfficiency Booster

- PowerShell-based system booster that disables visual effects and applies maximum performance mode  
- Automatically generates `MaxEfficiency_Report.bat` inside the `commands/` folder (visible in the panel)  
- Includes rollback script `RevertEfficiency.ps1` which auto-triggers on reboot and logs the reversal  
- Designed as an isolated experimental feature available via `DangerScripts/`

---

## ✅ 2. Project Structure

- `commands/` — visible public scripts and system-generated `.bat` reports  
- `DangerScripts/` — ⚠️ experimental/unsafe scripts (e.g. `MaxEfficiency.ps1`) hidden until “Risk Mode” is enabled  
- `assets/`, `Upd/`, and future modules like `AutoStartScripts/`, `KanoeSystem/` are structurally reserved

---

## ✅ 3. Panel UI and Logic

- `.bat` files placed into `commands/` auto-appear in the script runner UI  
- Scripts inside `DangerScripts/` remain hidden unless user enables “Risk Mode”  
- Defined theme for experimental mode: dark UI with red accents (Hard-Test style)

---

## ✅ 4. Future Ideas (In Progress)

- `AutoStartManager.ps1` and templates for autorun utilities (planned)  
- `autorun_catalog.md`, `V3.5_scripts_index.md`, `MaxEfficiency_Package.md` will be documented during the build  
- “Hard-Test” color theme with matching icon already proposed and ready for implementation

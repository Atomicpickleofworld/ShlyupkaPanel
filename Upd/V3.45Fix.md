# 🛠️ ShlyupkaPanel v3.45 — Fix Update

📅 Release Date: [coming soon]  
📦 Status: Patch Release  
🧩 Focus: flowDock button behavior & UI consistency

---

## ✅ Fixed Issues

- 🔧 **Dynamic Button Creation Bug**
  - After editing scripts via embedded editor, buttons were recreated improperly  
  - Issue caused layout shift, duplication or broken alignment in `flowDock`

- 🔧 **Post-Edit Refresh Desync**
  - `LoadScripts()` was re-triggering while script was already loaded  
  - Fixed by suppressing recursive `flowDock` redraws after script save

---

## 🔁 UI Refinements

- 🧼 Improved rendering stability after script updates  
- 🧠 Smarter name resolution for edited scripts — prevents mismatch between file name and button label  
- ✨ Cleaner refresh logic — panel resets only when changes are confirmed, not on every input

---

## 📘 Patch Notes

This is a maintenance update following the 3.4 Stable Beta release.  
It improves the responsiveness and visual accuracy of the ShlyupkaPanel command UI — especially when working with multiple scripts across formats.

Compatible with:
- `.bat`  
- `.ps1`  
- `.vbs`  
- `.cmd`
